# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: approximately 10 hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
[x] Username Enumeration
[x] Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
[x] SQL Injection (SQLi)
[x] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
[x] Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
[x] Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

  - Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection (SQLi)
      - blue/SQLi.gif

  - Vulnerability #2: Username Enumeration (If user exists then the response from website is bold otherwise not bold)
    - green/User Enumeration.gif

## Red

  - Vulnerability #1: Session Hijacking
    - red/Session Hijacking.gif

  - Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
